This repository is for completing the project assignement for Getting & Cleaning Data. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, 
and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

#Submitted in this repo are: 
        1. R Script for performing the analysis (run_analysis.R) 
        2. A Code book that provides more detail on the script (CodeBook.md) 
        3. The output from the script which is a tidy data set (tidy.data.csv)

#Before running the R script, you must: 
        Download the zip file from
                https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
        Save the unzipped folder and set it as your working directory
